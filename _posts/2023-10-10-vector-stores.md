# Myth-Busting: Vector Stores in AI

Having talked to multiple folks who are 'building AI', I've seen firsthand how easy it is to get swept up in the latest buzzwords. One such buzzword is 𝘝𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘰𝘳 𝘚𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘦𝘴.
Let's dissect some prevailing beliefs about vector stores:

### 1. Vector stores as the default
- **𝑴𝒚𝒕𝒉**: Vector stores are the default for all AI retrieval.
- **𝑹𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚**: While vector stores are powerful, they aren't always the best fit. For instance, if you're dealing with a database of Customer Events, a traditional query can efficiently fetch the data, which can then be processed by a language model for further insights.

### 2. The new era of application development
- **𝑴𝒚𝒕𝒉**: Vector stores signal a new era in application development.
- **𝑹𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚**: The underlying tech, like LLMs and embeddings, is based on transformer technology. It's an expansion, not a replacement. Think of it as adding a new tool to your workshop, not rebuilding the entire workshop.

### 3. The "AI-first" badge of honor
- **𝑴𝒚𝒕𝒉**: Using vector stores = "AI-first" badge of honor.
- **𝑹𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚**: Being "AI-first" is about strategy and innovation. For example, a company might use AI to enhance user experience, but that doesn't mean every tool in their stack is AI-driven.

### 4. Universality of vector search
- **𝑴𝒚𝒕𝒉**: Vector search is universally superior.
- **𝑹𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚**: It depends on the data. For unstructured data, vector search shines. But if you're searching a product catalog with specific attributes, traditional keyword search might be faster and more accurate.
