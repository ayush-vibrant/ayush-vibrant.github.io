# Understanding Venture Capitalist Exit Strategies
VCs are instrumental in the growth of startups. As these businesses evolve, VCs often look for exit strategies to realize their investments.

Here's a deep dive into some of the most common exit avenues:


## Key VC Exit Strategies
- **Trade Sale**: Selling the company to another business. E.g., Snapdeal's sale of FreeCharge to Axis Bank.
- **Initial Public Offering (IPO)**: Taking the company public, E.g. PayTM and Zomato.
- **Secondary Sale**: Selling shares to another investor. E.g., Early investors in Ola selling their stakes to SoftBank.
- **Buyback**: Where the company repurchases the VC's shares. E.g., Infosys' share buyback in 2017.
- **Merger or Acquisition**: Combining with another company, like Amazon's acquisition of Perpule.
- **Stake Buyout by a Later Stage Fund**: A later stage fund acquiring the VC's stake. E.g., Sequoia Capital buying out stakes in Byju's from earlier investors.
- **Write-off**: Accepting a loss and moving forward. Some early investors in Housing(dot)com wrote off their investments after the company faced challenges.
