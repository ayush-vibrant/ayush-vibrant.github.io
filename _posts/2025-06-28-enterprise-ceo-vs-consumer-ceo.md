# What Makes an Enterprise CEO Different from a Consumer CEO?

I'm observing how companies grow. There's a sharp difference between running a business that sells to other businesses and one that sells to everyday consumers. Let's keep it simple.

**An enterprise CEO** is a builder of ecosystems. Imagine you sell software to banks. Your job is not just to make good software. You need to form relationships, integrate with clients' systems, and support long, complicated sales cycles. It's dinner meetings, contract negotiations, and building trust brick by brick. Success is measured by how well your product fits into a larger business puzzle.

**A consumer CEO** faces a different world. Here, your product must win hearts in seconds. Think of a music app or a new phone. The user decides in a flash—download or delete. Growth depends on marketing, word of mouth, and the ability to scale quickly. Your moat is how many people use your product and how often they come back.

Let's look at "_founder mode_." This is the idea that founders, driven by vision and risk appetite, are best suited to lead their companies—especially early on. In consumer companies, founder mode often works longer. The founder's passion shapes the product and brand. In enterprise, the baton often passes sooner. As the business grows, the need for process, predictability, and managing big teams becomes central. An executive with experience in scaling operations might be better suited for the next phase.

Consider these examples. Brian Chesky at Airbnb is a consumer CEO who stayed in founder mode, keeping the brand fresh. In contrast, many enterprise companies—think of Satya Nadella at Microsoft—thrive when a leader with operational depth steps in, building on the founder's vision.

## In short:

- An enterprise CEO orchestrates complexity and relationships.
- A consumer CEO wins with simplicity and speed.
- Founder mode is vital at the start but may give way to a new style as the company matures, especially in enterprise.
