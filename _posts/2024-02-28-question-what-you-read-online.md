# Don't Believe Everything Online

I’ve been thinking about this point for quite a sometime. The internet has given many people a voice, including some whose silence might be more beneficial for society (at large).

In the unconscious mind, the producer operates from a position of power (strength) and consumer from a position of weakness. Creating a false imbalance, as consumers on absolute scale might be more intelligent and adept than the producer but the producer has a *loud voice*. This prevents the consumer from finding his own voice, leading him to doubt his thoughts more. And the voice of the producer becomes the fact, which is actually a hypothesis (often a poorly constructed one) at best.

What you need to constantly remind your conscious brain is that the ability to create content on the internet is very easy, it doesn’t cost much to do so, and there is no incentive for the producer to ensure the accuracy of the content he is posting. This is because less informed and slightly incorrect content often gets more engagement.

Remind yourself that whatever you are watching on the internet is not the absolute truth.

tl;dr *internet ki saare baatein aise ke aise nahi manni hoti*.
