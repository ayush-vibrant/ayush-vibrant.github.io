# Running observations (WIP)

- **Adaptive notification timing**:  New users need time to read alerts. Experienced users want them gone quickly.
Track how long someone has used your product. Show alerts longer for newcomers, shorter for veterans.
A browser's "press escape to exit fullscreen" alert works perfectly here. New users see it for 3 seconds. They need time to read and understand. As they learn your product, cut it to 2 seconds, then 1 second.
This respects user expertise while keeping helpful guidance.
