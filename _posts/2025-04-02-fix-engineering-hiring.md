## Improving the SWE Hiring Process: Beyond LeetCode Completionism to Hire Engineers Who Think, Not Just Solve

Been thinking about what small but meaningful improvements can be made in engineering hiring to better identify great engineers. Sure, you can completely overhaul the process—scrap LeetCode, get rid of system design rounds, block diagramming, and replace everything with a new, shiny system. But realistically, that’s not how it works. Hiring processes don’t transform overnight. They evolve incrementally.

### The Current Problem

One of the biggest criticisms of engineering interviews is the reliance on LeetCode-style problems. The internet is filled with arguments against them—how they don’t reflect real-world skills, how they filter out great candidates. Despite interviewers often claiming they "want to see your thinking process," there’s a strong bias towards solution completeness. I’ve read thousands of interview feedback reports, and time and again, I’ve seen candidates who demonstrated excellent problem-solving but didn’t finish the solution getting ranked lower than those who brute-forced their way to a complete answer. 

And sure, there are trade-offs—some companies need engineers who can articulate complex ideas, while others need independent go-getters. The key is knowing what you actually need rather than defaulting to completeness as the primary hiring signal.

### A Better Approach: Intellectual Vulnerability as Signal

A small but impactful shift in the interview process: Be upfront with candidates. Tell them clearly, "I’m going to give you a tough problem. You’re not expected to solve it completely, but I want to see how you break it down."

What you're actually evaluating:
- Can they decompose complex problems into manageable components?
- Do they recognize and articulate their knowledge boundaries?
- Can they treat certain elements as "black boxes" while advancing the overall solution?

For example, a strong candidate might say: "I'll use breadth-first search here, but I'm not certain about the optimal BFS implementation—let me treat that as a black box and continue. Next, I'll need external memory like a hashmap to store previously computed states for DP, though I'm unsure about the exact implementation..."

### Why This Matters for Team Performance

This approach tests for intellectual vulnerability—a critical trait that directly correlates with coachability. When engineers can verbalize their thought process while struggling, they demonstrate their ability to:
- Distinguish between known-knowns, known-unknowns, and unknown-unknowns.
- Define what success looks like.
- Break complex challenges into digestible components.
- Identify improvement opportunities.

Once engineers can articulate what they don’t know, teammates can efficiently help them find answers and accelerate their progress. This vulnerability-based assessment more accurately predicts how candidates will perform in real collaborative environments where perfect knowledge is rare but learning capacity is essential.

### Contextual Considerations

Different company stages demand different engineer archetypes—sometimes you need exceptional communicators, other times you need independent problem-solvers, and often you need both. Your interview process should reflect these specific needs rather than defaulting to solution completeness as the primary signal.

The goal of an interview isn’t just to assess who can grind through a problem the fastest. It’s to identify who can think, communicate, and grow. If an engineer can clearly outline the problem, break it down, identify gaps in their own knowledge, and still drive towards a solution—that’s someone worth hiring.
